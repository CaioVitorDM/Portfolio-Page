        <p>FULL STACK DEVELOPER | IT STUDENT</p>
      </div>
      <p class="description">
        Hello and welcome! My name is Caio, and I'm a dedicated Full-Stack Developer
        with a robust educational background in Information Technology from the Federal University of RN, Brazil.
        My journey in tech began with foundational programming in languages such as C, advancing to more complex
        systems involving Python, Java, and front-end technologies like Angular and TypeScript.<br><br>

        During my internship at the Federal Justice of Rio Grande do Norte, I developed key real-world skills by working
        on applications for the legal sector, leveraging Spring Boot for backend services and creating responsive designs
        that perform seamlessly across all devices. My projects not only improved the legal workflows but also deepened my
        understanding of UI/UX principles, making me adept at both the aesthetic and functional aspects of web development.<br><br>

        Currently, I am enhancing my skills further by developing a comprehensive application for Acer—the Acer Seller Center—utilizing
        AngularTS for frontend operations and integrating it with backend services using Java and Spring Boot, all managed through a PostgreSQL
        database. This project includes a significant integration with the VTEX platform, enhancing our e-commerce capabilities and ensuring a seamless
        connection between Acer’s operations and VTEX’s robust commerce solutions. This experience is refining my abilities in software testing, design patterns,
        effective programming practices, and complex system integrations.<br><br>

        My goal is to continue growing as a versatile developer, skilled in both frontend and backend paradigms, always eager to learn and apply my knowledge to solve
        complex problems. Check out my projects and connect with me through my social media links below to learn more about my professional journey and future aspirations.
